The propositional formulae, or pf for short, are built up from atoms by means of the
possibly infinitary operations
V A. A A. 1 1 iel i~l
of disjunction and conjunction, resp. Here I is a constructivm species, and for each i in I, A. i
is a pf already obtained. The definition should be understood constructively: VA i is given by
V, I and a function (i.e., rule) which associates the disjunct A i with each i in I. Similarly
for conjunction. We could take the species of pf to be the species which is inductively defined by
the above conditions. I leave open the question in this paper of the species I for which this
inductive definition of the species of pf can be constructively justifed. In the particular
applications discussed here, I is always of the form ~i:i ~ z), where z ~ ~; and in this case,
the definition is no more problematical than Brouwer's definition of the second number class, since
they are formally identical. However, it seems to me that undecidable species I can be introduced
as well. But I will discuss this in another paper, in which such applications will be considered.
In any case, for many applications, we want the pf to constitute, not the entire species which is
inductively defined by the above conditions, but some subspecies of this. Such a subspecies is called
complete if it contains each atom and, whenever it contains one of ~/A i and /~A i, it contains
both of them and the components A. for each i c I. Of course, the inductivmly defined species is
i
itself complete.
Henceforth, the pf will all be assumed to belong to some fixed complete species. To call A
a pf will mean that it belongs to this species.
Negation is not taken as a primitive operation, because for the purposes of this paper, it is
more convenient to deal with it as follows: Assume that each atom p has associated with it an atom
p, called its ~ ; and that conversely, p is the complement of p, i.e., p = p. The
complement ~ of an arbitrary pf A is inductively defined by De Morgan's laws:
VA i = AA i AA i = V~ i.
The negation of A will be identified with ~, with the advantage for us here that the classical
law of double negation becomes the syntactical identity ~ = A. Note that, by completeness, A is
________________
207
a
pf when A is.
Quantification is not introduced as primitive, either. This is because, without any loss, it can
be dealt with in terms of infinite disjunctions and conjunctions. We will take this point up below.
In order to make the structure of derivations as simple as possible, the objects to be derived are
taken to be finite sets P, A, etc., of pf, rather than single pf. These sets are interpreted
disjunctively, so that [Ao,...,An_l] is valid just in case V A i is. P + A will denote the
i<n
union of P and &, P + A will denote P + [A]; and sometimes, A will denote [A}.
Let S be a collection of finite sets of atoms with the
INTERSECTION PROPERTY. If P + p and & + p are in S, then so is some subset of P + A.
S will be called an axiom s~stem, and its elements axioms. For example, the axiom system might
consist of all true propositional constants (including the complements of false ones) together with
the sets p + p for each propositional variable p. But, it will be useful, e.g., in treating
predicate logic with identity below, to consider the more general kind of axiom system.
Relative to the choice of an axiom system, the normal rules of inference are the rule of axioms

direct subderivations. The instances of A are derivations, and all other derivations are built
up from these using the remaining rules of inference. D ~ A will mean that D is a derivation of
A, and ~ A will mean that there is a derivation of A.
The species of derivations is thus inductively defined, relative to the species of pf. We
have relativized the notion of pf from the full inductively defined species to some suitable
(i.e. complete) subspecies. It is also possible to do this for the notion of a derivation. In this
case, to see what a "suitable" subspecies would be, we would have to analyze the closure conditions
on the notion of a derivation which suffice for the proof of the Elimination Theorem to go through.
For a classical treatment of infinitary logic, this has recently been done by Barwise [i] : Both the
pf and the derivations are relativized to some admissible set. (This includes the condition of
completeness for the set of pf. ) But, so far, no constructively meaningful treatment of this
problem has been given.

2o9
A derivation is called normal if it involves only normal inferences, i.e., if it contains no
cuts. In a normal inference, every pf which occurs in a premise is a part, or subformula, of a
pf in the conclusion. It follows from this, for example, that if a set of atoms has a normal
derivation, then some subset of it must be an axiom. The Elimination Theorem states in part that
every derivable set has a normal derivation. An immediate consequence is the
CONSISTENCY THEOREM. Every derivable set of atoms includes an axiom.
ConsistencY in the usual sense means that not every set is derivable. But by the Consistency Theorem,
this is equivalent to the condition that the null set is not an axiom. The statement of the
Consistency Theorem is not itself significant, of course. Nonconstructively, it is a triviality.
The significance lies in the fact that it is proved constructively.
~ . By a valuation, I will mean a set of atoms which contains at least one element
of each axiom and at most one of p and p for each atom p. Each atom in a valuation will be
called true for it. VA i ( /~A i) will be called true for a valuation if Aj is true for some (all)
j in I. d is valid if, for each valuation, some pf in d is true. A pf is called countable
if it contains only countable disjunctions and conjunctions.
COMPLETENESS THEOREM. If a finite set of countable pf is valid, it has a normal derivation.
I will omit the proof of this. (See Lopez-Escobar [7].) It is in complete analogy with the proof
of completeness of the cut-free rules for predicate logic (which it implies). The main lemma needed
is this :
If M
an axiom.
is a (possibly infinite) set of atoms which intersects each valuation~ then it includes
The Completeness Theorem is formulated in slightly greater generality than usual, because normally
it is stated only for logically complete axiom systems, i .e., systems in which some subset of p +
is an axiom for each atom p. For logically complete systems, a valuation contains exactly one of
p and p for each atom p; and so, the definition of truth is the usual one for classical logic.
We have not assumed logical completeness in the definition of an axiom system, simply because it is
not needed for the Elimination Theorem. (It also turns out that the Intersection Property is exactly
what is needed to prove the above lemma. )

The restriction to countable pf in the Completeness Theorem is known to be essential. (E.g.
see Karp [61 .) A particularly simple proof of this is possible using the present formulation of
infinitary logic. Let the atoms be p0,Pl,p2,.., 0 0 0 and their complements p0,Pl,P2, 1 1 1
..., resp. The
axioms are just the sets pO + pl for n _~ 0. (This is the weakest logically complete system.) If
f ranges over the uncountable set 2 N of numerical functions with values < 2, then
(+)
V A p~(n) f n
is valid. Suppose that it had a normal derivation D. Because of the subformula property of normal derivations, the only conjunctions occurring in D must be of the form A _e(n)
p n where 0 is some
function in 2 N. Hence, in every instance of rule A-and so, of any rulemthere are only a countable
number of premises. It follows that D can contain only a countable number of pf. In particular,
there are only a countable number of 0, say 00,01,..., such that an inference of the form
F + Ap~ (n)
F + VfA~n
_f(n)
occurs in D. Consequently, D would remain a correct derivation if f in (+) were restricted to
range over 00,0 I, .... But, so modified, (+) is invalid. Therefore, there is no normal derivation
of (+), and so, by the Elimination Theorem, no derivation at all.
A similar argument demonstrates the (known) nonderivability of the axiom of choice
V APmn
+
V A Pug(n) m n g m
where g ranges over N N and the axioms are Pmn +Pmn for each m and n. Again, the crucial
point is that the conjunctions are all countable, while g cannot be restricted to a countable range.
w 2. The strong form of the Elimination Theorem requires the introduction of a suitable con-
structive system of ordinals to measure the complexity of pf and the length of derivations. In
classical terms, let xO(x) = 2 x, let xZ(x), for z > O, be the x th simultaneous solution y of
the equations xU(y) -- y for all u < z. It is well-known that xZ(x) exists for all countable
ordinals x and z [i01. Let x = 2 x 0 , ... * 2 x
m and y = 2Yo
+ ... + 2 yn
", where x 0 > --. ~ x m
________________
211
and Y0 ~ "'' ~ Yn' and let z 0 ~ z I ~ ... ~ Zm+ n be all the x i and yj (counting multiple
z 0 occurrences). Then the natural sum x o y of x and y is defined by x o y = 2 + ... + 2 zm+n
The natural sum is commutative and strictly increasing. Various authors, e.g., Schutte [lO], have
given constructive systems of ordinals on which the functions xZ(x) and x o y are defined. We
will assume that some such system has been chosen; and all discussion of ordinals should be referred
to it.
The relation A ~ u (A is of rank ~ u) is to measure the complexity of the pf A. It is
inductively defined as follows: p ~ u for every atom p and every ordinal u. If for each i in
I there is a u i ~ u with A i ~u i, then VA i ~ u and /kAk~U. For a given pf A, there need
not be a u with A ~ u. This will depend on the choice of the system of ordinals and on the species
I admitted in the construction of pf. Also, even if A 9 u, there need not be a least such u
which we can effectively determine. For this reason, we cannot regard the rank of A itself as an
ordinal. A 9 u will mean that A 9 for some x ( u. Thus, V A. 9 Just in case A. 9 for
each i in I; and similarly for conjunction. It is clear that A and ~ have the same rank,
i.e., that A 9 if and only if A 9 u.
A derivation D is said to be of cut degree ~ u if A 9 u for every mt A of a cut
7§163247
in D. Thus, D is of cut degree 0 (i.e., ~ O) Just in case it is normal. The mt of cuts are
usually called the cut formulae.
The relation D 9 u (D is of rank ~ u) is inductively defined by the condition that, for
every direct subderivation D' of D, D' 9 u (i.e., D' 9 u' for some u' (u). This gives a
B
measure of the length of a derivation. Instances of A are of rank 0 (i.e., < 0). As in the
case of pf, a derivation needn't have a bound on its rank, or in any case, a least one.
D ~ ~ [u,vB
will mean that D is a derivation of A of rank < u and cut degree < v. We will write [u] for
m
[u,0] so that D ~ A [u] means that D is a normal derivation of A of rank < u.
Let D + A denote the result of adding A to the st of each inference in the derivation D.
________________
212
Then by a straightforward induction on u:
WEAKENING LEMMA. If D ~ F [u,v], then D + A ~ F + A[u,v].
A finite set 8 of pf is called a reduction of a pf A if 8 contains a mt of each
inference of which A is a pt. There are three kinds of reduction: First, A is an atom which does
not occur in any axiom, and 8 is arbitrary. Secondly, A is a finite disjunction, and 8 contains
each disjunct. (Infinite disjunctions, i.e., with infinitely many distinct disJuncts, have no
reductions.) Thirdly, A is a conSunction , and 8 contains at least one of the conJuncts.
REDUCTION LEMMA. If 8 is a reduction of A and D ~ F + A [u,v], then 5 F + 8 [u,v].
The proof is by induction on u. We can assume that A is not in F, since otherwise the result
follows by weakening, taking D + 8. We can also assume that A is a st of the last inference of
D, replacing D by D + A if necessary. So this inference has the form
A+A+B.
A+A+A
(J in J)
where F = A + ~, A+ A is the set of st, and either A or A + A is the set of pt. For each J
in J there is a uj < u with ~ A + A + Bj [uS,v] ; and so by the induction hypothesis (ind. hyp.),
A + e + Bj [Us,V]. If A is not a pt, then the result follows by the inference

If A is a pt, then B S is in 8 for some J, and so ~ A + @ [uS,v]. The result then follows

Recall that an axiom system is logically complete if some subset of p + p is an axiom for e&e~
atom p. If we assume logical completeness, then the usual laws of classical logic can be derived.
The crucial case is the
LAW OF EXCLUDED MIDDLE. If the system is lo~ically complete and A~u, then ~ A + ~ [2"u].
The proof is by induction on u. If A is an atom, then A + A is an instance of rule A. If A
is not an atom, we can assume it is a disjunction ~/Ai, since otherwise A is a disjunction and

and so by the ind. hyp.,
and so by ~, FA + A [2.u],
since
Most of the proof theory involved is contained in the
ELIMINATION L~:~MA. Let D ~r + A [x,v] and D' ~ d + A [y,v], where A 9 v; and let
u = x o y. Then F F + d [u,v].
Of course, we obtain a derivation of F + A of cut degree < v + 1
by an application of the cut
rule; but the object of the lemma is to show that we needn't raise the cut degree.
The proof is by induction on u. Since ~ = A, x o y = y o x, and A and
rank, the lemma is symmetric with respect to the two given derivations.
Case i. Either A is not a pt in the last inference of D or else A is not a pt in the
last inference of D'. By sy~netry, we can assume the former. Then the last inference of D is of
the form

for
A+A+B~
A+A+O
(j in J)
since the uj are < u and, if this inference is a cut, its mt must be of rank < v.
Case 2. A is a pt of the last inference of D and A is a pt of the last inference of D'.
Case 2a. A (and A) are atoms. Then the last (and only) inferences of D and D' are
instances of rule A. It follows from the intersection Property that F + A is also an instance of A.
________________
~4
Case 2b. A and A are not atoms. By symmetry, we can assume that A is a disjunction
k/A i, and so A = /kA i. We can assume that A is a st of the last inference of D, replacing
D by D + A if necessary. So that inference is of the form
F+A+Aj
F+A
for some J in I, and ~P + A + Aj [z,v] for some z < x. Since z o y <u, it follows from
the ind. hyp. that ~ F + & + Aj [z @ y,v]. Also, by the Reduction Lemm~, ~ & + Aj [y,v]. Since
x >0, y < x e y = u; and z @ y < u. Also, A i 9 v, since A 9 v. So the result follows from the

First, assume that the last inference of D is not a cut. Then it is of the form

Actually, the restriction to natural numbers is not essential, m and n can be regarded as ranging
over any species, but the applications here concern the natural numbers.
Let men be fixed. The relation n 9 u (n is of rank < u) is inductively defined by the
i
condition.that, for every mC n there is a u m <u with m - 9 u m . n 9 u means that n --
9 x for
some x < u. Of course, even when the ordering m Cn is well-founded, n needn't have a rank u,
i.e., with n 9 u. E.g., m C n could be a well-ordering of which the system of ordinals is a proper
segment. When C coincides with the ordering < of the ordinals, then n ~ z is clearly equivalent
to n < z. Under fairly general conditions~left for the reader to determinewm 9 z means that there
is an ordinal valued function ~, defined for all m Cn, such that k CmCn implies

w It remains to be seen how the Elimination Theorem applies when quantifiers are added to the
system. In this case, the atoms are of the form Ps I ... s n (n ~0), where P is a predicate symbol
of n arguments and Sl,...,s n are terms built up in the usual way from free variables a, b, etc.,
and function symbols (including individual constants). Each predicate symbol P has a complement
~, with P = P; and the complement Ps I ..- s n of an atom is defined to be ~Sl,...,s n. Besides
disjunction and conjunction, formulae may be built up using existential and universal quantification
V~(x) A~(x)
where x is a bound variable (notationally distinct from free variables) and A(x) results from
replacing a free variable b by x in a formula A(b) which does not contain x. The formulae
obtained in this way, and which contain only a finite number of free variables, will be called
quantificational formulae, or qf. Complementation is extended to qf by
V~(x) = A xA(x) A~(x) =V~-'('~',
and the rank relation by: If
we have fixed a complete species of

SUBSTITUTION PROPERTY. If ~(b) is an axiom, then for each term s, some subset of ~(s) is
an axiom.
A(s) is, of course, the result of replacing b by the term s in each qf in A(b). The additional
normal rules of inference for this system are the rule of existential quantification
F + A(s) (some term s) r + V xA(x)
and the rule of universal quantification
v r r + + A
A(b) (b not in F) .
Since the axioms are closed under substitutions, it is easy to see that ~ A(b) [u,v] implies
A(s) [u,v] for all terms s. In particular, if b is not in F, then F F + A(b) [u,v] implies
F + A(s) [u,v] for all s. This shows that the rule V can be interchanged with the infinitary

variables in these q.f., there will always be such an s.)
Let to,tl,... , be an enumeration of all the terms. Each qf can be regarded as a pf by
identifying
V xA(x) = V n A(tn), A xA(x) = i n
A(tn) .
It is evident that the relation A 9 u is independent of whether A is regarded as a qf or as a
pf. Moreover, if we regard qf as pf, then they form a complete species of pf, and the rules 3
and V' are simply special cases of V and ~A' resp. It therefore follows that

A [u,v] holds in quantificational lo~ic (using the rules

just in case it holds
The Elimination Theorem thus holds for quantificational logic, too. This includes quantiflcational
logic with identity, since we obtain the theory of identity by including the sets s = s and
s = t + ~ + A(t) Among the axioms for all terms s and t, and all atoms A(b).
A finitar~ qf is one which contains only binary disjunctions and conjunctions, A V B and
A A B, resp. Finitar~ predicate logic refers to the systems obtained by restricting the rules of
inference to finitary qf (which form a complete species). All finitary qf have finite rank, and
all derivations in finitary predicate logic have finite rank, and so, have finite cut degree.

Gentzen proved this for pure logic, i.e., when the axioms are all of the form Ps I 9 "" Sn + ~s I ... s n

Now, consider qf which contain no free individual variables, whose function symbols are
computable function constants (including the numerals ~,[,...), and whose predicate symbols are
decidable predicate constants and predicate variables. These qf will be called numerical for~alae
(nf). Each term of this system has a unique numerical value (on the intended interpretation) which
we can compute. Besides the Intersection Property, we assume that the axiom system satisfies the
condition that, if n is the value of the term s, then for every axiom A(s), some subset of
A(n) is an axiom. (A(s) and A([) are obtained from A(b) by replacing all occurrences of b by
s and n n, resp.) Number Theor~ is the system whose formulae are the nf and whose rules of

Peano arithmetic is a system of finitary predicate logic with the rule
+ A(:) r + A(b) + A(b')
r + A(s)
of mathematical induction added to the rules of inference (where b is not free in s (The
numerals are 0,1 = 0', etc.) The axioms are the axioms of identity mentioned above,
0 = s', s' = t' + s = t and certain atoms which express defining equations for recursive functions.
Suppose that A consists of formulae without quantifiers, and that there is a normal derivation of
A in Peano arithmetic. Then it is clear that no quantifiers occur in the derivation. I.e., A is
derivable in quantifier-free Peano arithmetic. Now, the consistency of quantifier-free Peano arithmetic
is expressed by a quantifier-free formula (with a free variable), and is derivable in Peano arithmetic.
Therefore, the cut rule C is not redundant in Peano arithmetic. However, Schutte [6] has observed
that the rule of mathematical induction can be eliminated in favor of the ~-rule N, using the
schema
F + A(:) F + A(:) + A(:)
r + A(:) r + A(I) + A(:)
r + A(:)
etc., applying the rule C with cut formulae A(~).
Since the derivation in Peano arithmetic is of finite rank and of finite cut degree, it transforms
into a derivation of rank < w 2 and finite cut degree in number theory. So the theorems of Peano
2 arithmetic all have normal derivations of rank < 2 w k < ~0( =
• for some k. So, ~0 is a bound
________________
222
on the provable ordinals of Peano arithmetic. It is the least such bound, by Gentzen [5], in fact.
Schutte [9] notes more generally that if mathematical induction is replaced in Peano arithmetic by
induction on some decidable partial ordering C of rank m
< z:
F + A y(yCb V A(y)) V A(b)
F
+
A(t)
then each derivation is transformed into one in number theory of finite cut degree and rank
Hence, the bound on the provable ordinals in this case is the least xl(u) > z.

Suppose that we add to Peano arithmetic the above rule of induction on C for some standard
well-orderin~ of the natural numbers of type 2 w+l for each k > 0 It seems possible that the cut
-k -- 9
rule is redundant in this system; but I do not know a proof of this 9
w Ramified systems can also be treated in the framework of infinitary propositional logic 9
Instead of ramified type theory, however, I will discuss ramified (or constructible) set theory, which
is notationally simpler. But an analogous account of ramified type theory and ramified analysis can
be given.
For each ordinal z, terms and formulae of level z, called z-terms and z-formulae, resp., are
built up as follows: Each free z-variable a z, b z, etc., and z-constant is a z-term. If P is a
predicate symbol of n arguments, s i is a zi-term for i = l,...,n, and z = max(zl,...,Zn), then
Ps l,...,s n is a z-formula. If A and B are u- and v-formulae, rasp 9 and z = max(u,v), then
A v B and A A B are z-formulae. If A(b V) is a u-formula which does not contain the bound
v-variable x V, and z = max(u,v + i), then V xA(x) and A xA(x) are z-formulae and XxA(x) is
a z-term. (I am following the practice of dropping the level superscript on variables once the level
has been established, or when the level is irrelevant. ) Complementation is defined as usual, with
Ps l,...,s n = Ps l,. 9 n and P = P. The binary predicate symbol E will play a special role, and we
will write set for s The atoms are the formulae PSl,...,Sn, except when P is e or ~.
s at or s~t is an atom only when t is a variable or constant, i.e., when it is not of the form ~,xA(x)..
The axiom system is to be a collection of finite sets o~ atoms with the Intersection Property
and the Substitution Property, i.e., if &(b z) is an axiom and s is a term of level < z, then
some subset of A(s) is an axiom. The rules of inference are A, V and /k (restricted to

(s is a term of level < z)
-
P + A(s) (all s of level < z) P + A xZA(x z)

(s of level < z) F + s e %xZA(x z)
and
r
+
~(s)
(s is of level ~ r + s ~ AxZA(x z)
< z)
The intended interpretation of the terms is this: The objects of level 0 are individuals.
The x + 1 objects are attributes of objects of levels ~ x. If z is a limit ordinal, the z
objects are precisely the objects of level < z. In keeping with this interpetation, we should consider
only terms and formulae which contain no free variables or constants of limit levels. Also, instead
of considering an arbitrary domain of individuals, we could take the 0 objects to be the natural
numbers. In this case, as in number theory, we would consider only terms and formulae without free
O-variables. However, for those levels z (e.g., z = x + l) for which the terms and formulae contain
free z-variables, the rule V z can be interchanged with
F + A(b z) (b not in F) r +
A xZA(x z)
without affecting the ranks of the derivations involvedDas in the case of quantificational logic.
The z-degree A* of a formula A is defined for each ordinal z as follows: If A is of
level < z, then A* = 0. Assume now that A is of level > z. If A is an atom, then A* = 0.
If A is B V C or B ^ C, then A* = max(B*,C*) + i. If A is s e )~B(x), s ~ P~xB(x),
V xB(x) or /kxB(x), then A* = B(b)* + i. It is easy to show that:
________________
224
If A(b x) is of level z, z' < z, and s is of level < z', then A(s)* = A(b)*.
To each z-formula A we assign a pf A' of rank <~. z + A*, as follows: If z = 0, then
A' = A. Assume that z > 0 and that B' is defined for all B of level < z and for all
z-formulae B of z-degree < k. Let A be a z-formulae of z-degree k. If A is an atom, then
~X z! - Z!~ A' = A. If A is s e B(x ) (where z' < z), then A is B(s)' or the empty disjunction
l, (i.e. k/ A i with I empty), depending on whether s is of level ~ z' or not. In either
i e I
case, A' is defined, since if s is of level < z', then B(s)* = B(b)* < k. If A is
m
Z I Z ! S ~ kX B(x ), then A' is B(s)' or I , depending on whether s is of level ~ z' or not. If
! Z v A = B V C then A' = B' V C', and if A = B A C then A' = B' A C'. Let A be k/x z B(x ), and
Z ! Z ! Z t I let t O ,t I ,... be an enumeration of all terms of level ~ z'. Then A' is k/ B(t n ) . Since
n
each B(t ) is of z-degree < k, B(t ) 9 w 9 z + i. Hence, A' ~w 9 z + k. If A is
! Z ! ~! A x z B(x ), then A' is A n B(t ) . It is clear that the species of A', for A a formula of
ramified set theory, is complete.
Let &' denote the set of A' with A in A. Under this translation, 3z and V z become
special cases of ~ and A, resp., and k and ~~ become redundant, since the premise and
conclusion translate into the same set. Thus:
Ey. ery derivation of rank _< u of A in ramified set theor~ which involves only formulae of
level < z, transforms into a derivation of A, in propositional logic of rank _< and cut degree
<•'Z.
It immediately follows that the provable ordinals of ramified set theory of level _< w z, using
derivations of rank _< u, are all of rank _< • (Cf Schutte [13] for the analogous result
for ramified type theory. ) Of course, we have not proved an elimination theorem for ramified set
theory, itself; but it would not he difficult to do so, by showing that ~ A, [u, vl in propositional
logic implies that there is a derivation of A is ramified set theory of rank ( 2 9 u involving
m
only formulae of level < z.

(i.e. second order number theory).

The analytic formulae (af) are built up from atoms Rs I --. an, where R is a predicate
constant or, if n = l, a free predicate variable and Sl,...,s n are constant terms of number theory,
by means of countable disjunctions and conjunctions and the quantifications
VZA(Z) AZA(Z)
over predicates of one argument. A(Z) is obtained from an af A(P) which does not contain I Z by
replacing each part Ps or ~s by Zs or Zs, resp. P will always denote a prepredicate variable.
Bound variables -- X,Y,Z,Xl, etc. -- are distinct from free ones. We will require of an af that
it contain only a finite number of free variables. The complement ~ of an af A and the rank
relation A ~ z are defined in the usual way.
The definition of an af is an extension of the usual one, which refers to finitar~ af. In
these, the onS~v infinite disjunctions and conjunctions are the numerical quantifications V A(~)
n
and A n
A(~); and so, finitary af are always of finite rank.
A predicate F = F(b) is obtained from an af which contains no quantifiers by replacing zero
or more constant terms by the individual variable b. A(F1,...,F )
denotes the result of replacing
P.s l and P.s l in A(P1,.. "'Pn ) by Fi( s) and Fi(s)

Let S denote the list F0,FI,... of predicates F n = Fn(b ). S is of rank < z, written
S 9 z, if F 9 z for all n. S is closed if it contains all the atomic predicates (i.e. containing
-- n --
no logical constants) and if, whenever G(P) is in the list S, then so is G(Fn) for each n.
Suppose that S is not closed. Let S 1 be an enumeration of S together with all the atomic
predicates; and let Sk+ 1 (for k > 0) be an enumeration of S k together with all predicates
G(G1,...,Gn) where G(P1,...,Pn) is in S1, P1,...,Pn are variables, and G1,...,G n are in S k.
Let S' be an inumeration of U S k. Then S' is closed, and is called the closure of S. If
k
S _ 9 z, then clearly, S k_ 9 z.k; and so S' _ 9 z.w.
Let S be a closed list of predicates. A species of af is called S-complete if it contains
all the atoms, if it contains A whenever it contains A, if it contains each A whenever it
n
contains VAn, and if it contains A(Fn) whenever it contains V ZA(Z). (S) will denote a
system of elementary analysis whose af constitute an S-complete species and in which the predicates
of quantification in instances of 3 are restricted to predicates in S.
To each af A of (S) we assign a pf A(S) = A' by: A' = A if A is atomic. (VAn)' =

instance of A, then either A + is an instance of A or else it includes a set Fij(s) + Fij(t )
where s and t are equal terms (and ~js + Pit is in A). But Fij(s ) + Fij(t ) has a normal
derivation of rank 2 9 z, since S is of rank < z. (This is the law of excluded middle, when
s = t. The proof is exactly the same when s and t are equal terms.) If the last inference in
the derivation of A is an instance of V or /k, there is no difficulty, since these inferences
are preserved under the translation of A into A +. A cut with cut formula B is transformed into
a cut with cut formula B +. Since B < v, we have B + 9 z + v. The inference

Peano arithmetic refers to the formal system obtained by adding predicate quantifiers to Peano
arithmetic with the rules 3 and ~, but with the predicates of quantification restricted to atomic
predicates. (Of course, the rule of mathematical induction is to apply to arbitrary formulae of this
system, and not Just those of Peano arithmetic. ) By the above result, E 0 is still the bound on the
provable ordinals of this system. Kreisel has pointed out that this bound remains the same even if we
add arbitrary true axioms of the from V ZA(Z) to the system, where A(P) contains no predicate
quantifiers--although the proof of this is nonconstructive: Since V ZA(Z) is true, we can introduce
a solution R with true axioms P~ or ~ for each n, so that there is a normal derivation of
A(R), and so of V ZA(Z), of finite rank. So (nonconstructivity), every derivation of the extended

EXAMPLE. Let M be the system obtained from pure second order Peano arithmetic by adding the
rule: If A(b) and B(b) are ~ and ~l' resp., then (*)
r + VZ Ax(Zx +-cA(x))
is the union of a hierarchy (~) of systems, k _> 0, where ~ does not contain the rule
(*), and, for each instance of (*) in a derivation in ~+l, the subderivations of the premises
A(b) + ~ and ~ + B(b) are derivations in ~. The formulae of ~ can be regarded as finitary
af by reading k/x ~nd i x as disjunction and conjunction, resp. Let S0 be a list of all atomic
predicates, and let sk+l be a closed list generated by sk and all the predicates A(~) when ~ is
obtained by replacing all but a finite number of predicate variables in the predicate is sk by the
fixed constant Q and A = A(b) is a finitary ~ af. Thus, sk <_ k. Let S' be an enumeration
of the union of the sk(k > 0). So S' is closed and of rank _< ~. Let @(0) = 2 and
~(k + l) = k + @(k), and let %(0) = ~ and ~(k + l) = k + $(k).
I._f.f ~A in ~, then ~A [u,v] i__nn (~k) for some u <@(k) an_~d v <#(k). So, ~A i._nm
implies 5 A [u,v] i__nn (~) for some u and v < ~.
For k = 0, this is clear, since ~0 is pure second order Peano arithmetic. Assume that it is true

So ~ A in ~ yields a normal derivation in (S k) of A with rank ~ xk( ... XI(2~) ...) for
some r < m and u <w k + ... + m I + m 2. For example, xl(• = ee0 is a bound on the provable
ordinals of ~ and XW(0) is a bound on the provable ordinals of ~. I do not know whether or not
these bounds are optimal.

We will prove it for d" d is ~2d with no instances of (*). A derivation in 2d contains an
instance of (*) only when the subderivations of the premises are derivations in ~2d. Every derivation
in ~2d of A transforms into a derivation of some ~ = A + [ /kx My Pd(Y,~Ai(~) ~ A VxAi(x):

Pd(m,~Ai(n) ") is false, its complement is an axiom; and when it is true, we obtain from m a proof
of Ai(n) in ~d" So, in any case, ~ Pd(m,~Ai(~) ") + Ai(~ ) in ~d' for each m and n. So
b AxVy Pd(y,rAi(~) ") VAxAi(x)[m m'x + 4,m m'x]

let ~k+l enumerate the closure of ~k and the predicates A(~), where A = A(b) is a finitary Y i l af. So, ~ ~ ~'x 9 k. Set (P(0) = ~ ~.x + ~, and ~(k + i) = ~ ~ -x "~ k

shown that ~A in ~2d implies ~A [u,v] in (~) for some u and v < ~(0). Assume that FA
in ~2d implies ~ A [u,v] in (~) for some u and v < q~(k). Exactly as in the case of ~ (in
place of d ) above, it follows that ~ A in 2d implies ~ A [u,v] in (~+l) with u and
v < ~.x. k + ~(k) = q~(k + 1), since ~k < ~.x.k. Let ~2d enumerate the union of the ~k ~d

Thus, • 9 2)) is a bound on the provable ordinals of ~d when d < z.

the restriction that A(b,P) be in the list S of predicates. I will show that, if A is ~i i
(i.e. contains only Z 1 1 af) and ~ A [u,v] in Z(S), then ~A [u'] in (S') where S' and u' depend on u and v. It is not known whether there is such a constructive elimination theorem for
arbitrary sets A of af. (Of course, nonstructively, we obtain such an elimination theorem for the
full analytic comprehension axiom by taking S' to be a countable model of constructible sets.)
For the sake of simplicity, I will consider only Z(SO) , where S 0 is an enumeration of the
finitarypredicates; but the extension to arbitrary S is straightforward.

This follows from the proof of the Elimination Theorem for elementary analysis. For, the Elimination
Lemma remains valid except for the case that the cut formula A or A is pt of an instance of Z 1 1 AC; and in that case it is of the required form.
Let Po,PI,... be variables not occuring in the finitary predicate A(b,P). Set

We call K the choice predicate for A(b,P) relative to S.
Let S 0 be the finitary predicates; and for z > O, let ~z be the closure of the union of all
the ~x with x < z and all choice predicates for finitary A(b,P) relative to lists S derived
from some S x with x < z. S is derived from S if it is obtained by replacing all but a finite X
number of predicate variables in each predicate in S by the constant Q. Here, Q is to be fixed,
X
once and for all. Note that a choice predicate relative to such a derived list is a predicate: It
contains only a finite number of variables. For each z, we clearly have S Z -- <

The proof is by induction on u. When the last step in the strict derivation of A is by A, ~,~

increasing in u. The last step is not by ~ since & is Z I. i
So, we need only consider the cases ~i I AC and C. Let the last step be by Z i

EXAMPLE. Let E be pure second order Peano arithmetic with ~i i
A~C and the arithmetic compre-
hension axiom
P + A(F) r + VZA(Z)
added (where A(P) contains no predicate quantifiers). Of course, in Z 1
I A~C, /~ should be inter-
n preted as /kx and A(b,P) is a formula of (first order) Peano arithmetic. Suppose that all the
predicate quantifiers in A are existential and ~ A in ~. Then ~ A [u,v] in Z(SO), with
u < ~ and v < ~. Then by III, ~ [x] with x < E O. So, ~A [xX(o)] in Sx, by IV. Since

This result is proved by H. Friedman in his dissertation (Subsystems of set theor~ and analysis, M.I.T.)
by a translation of % into ramified analysis. Theorem (6.19) of Feferman [2] seems to show that
the bound x-O(o) is optimal.
